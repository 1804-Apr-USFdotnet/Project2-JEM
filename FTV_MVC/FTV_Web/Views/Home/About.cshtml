                I believe that software is a tool which improve so many of our activities: by providing software we can open so many possibilities.

                People have unique skills and competencies and software should be there to complement them, to help them performin analysis quickly, to help them visualize ideas, to run checks and calculations for them. So that people can focus on using their abilities to provide more value.

                To me building software means to provide tools to people.

                I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, and then a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of California Santa Barbara. While attending UCSB, I began my software engineering career as a VMS Systems Programmer for General Research Corporation, holding a secret security clearance. There I became one of the divisions top programmers, updating device drivers, writing the EDX Editor which became very popular, and earning steady recognition for outstanding contributions.

                I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs. When I'm not coding, tweeting or pushing pixels, you'll find me cooking, eating or exercising in the park.
